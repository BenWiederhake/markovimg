## Install

You need PIL (pillow) and Python >= 3.7.  Most developers already have those, so I don't supply a `requirements.txt`.

## Usage

Just use it!  No dependencies (beyond PIL), and it's short enough.

`./markovimg.py [YOURFILENAMEHERE.png]`

If 30 seconds is too slow for you, try out lower resolutions.  Remember to adjust things like number of colorpoints!

## Performance

Bad.  It's unoptimized python.  I just share it because it's pretty pictures.

## TODOs

* Play around with it until I get bored.

## NOTDOs

* Anything professional
